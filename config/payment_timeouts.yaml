# Configuration for Fix: Payment timeout handling in transaction processor
# **Problem**: Payment processor timing out after 30s during peak traffic (Black Friday), causing 3.2% transaction failure rate. Customers experiencing "Transaction failed, please try again" errors.

**Root Cause**: Database connection pool exhaustion under high concurrent load (>500 TPS). No retry mechanism for transient timeouts.

**Solution**:
- Increased timeout from 30s to 60s for payment authorization calls
- Added exponential backoff retry (3 attempts, 2s/4s/8s delays)
- Implemented circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascade failures
- Enhanced monitoring with payment_timeout_errors metric

**Impact**: Reduces timeout-related failures by ~85% based on staging tests. Improves customer experience during high-traffic periods.

**Rollback Plan**: Feature flag `enable_payment_retry_v2` allows instant rollback.
