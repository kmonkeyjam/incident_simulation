# Configuration for Feature: Real-time payment notifications and webhooks
# **Merchant Demand**: 89% of enterprise merchants requesting real-time payment notifications. Current email notifications have 2-5 minute delays.

**Webhook System Architecture**:
- **Event Types**: payment.completed, payment.failed, refund.processed, chargeback.created, settlement.completed
- **Delivery Guarantees**: At-least-once delivery with idempotency keys
- **Retry Strategy**: Exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s, 32s, 60s, 120s)
- **Timeout**: 30-second webhook delivery timeout

**Security Implementation**:
- **HMAC-SHA256 Signatures**: Verify webhook authenticity
- **Timestamp Validation**: Reject webhooks >5 minutes old
- **IP Allowlisting**: Optional merchant IP restrictions
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: All webhook URLs must be HTTPS

**Merchant Configuration**:
- Multiple webhook endpoints per merchant
- Event filtering (subscribe to specific event types)
- Custom headers and authentication
- Webhook testing tools in merchant dashboard

**Reliability Features**:
- Dead letter queue for permanently failed webhooks
- Webhook delivery status dashboard for merchants
- Real-time delivery metrics and alerting
- Circuit breaker for problematic merchant endpoints

**Performance Requirements**:
- 10,000+ webhooks/second capacity
- <100ms webhook delivery initiation
- 99.9% successful delivery rate (excluding merchant endpoint issues)

**Monitoring**: 
- Webhook delivery success rates by merchant
- Average delivery latency tracking
- Failed webhook alerting and auto-retry
