Fix: Revert merchant fee calculation changes

This module implements changes related to: **EMERGENCY ROLLBACK** - Incident #INC-2024-1156

**Issue**: Merchant fee calculation v2.1 deployed at 14:32 UTC causing incorrect fee calculations:
- 847 merchants overpaid by average $23.45 (total $19,526 impact)
- 1,203 merchants underpaid by average $8.67 (total $10,430 impact)
- Affects all transactions processed between 14:32-15:45 UTC

**Immediate Actions**:
- Reverting to fee_calculator.py v2.0.3 (last known good version)
- Pausing all fee processing until rollback complete
- Finance team calculating merchant reimbursements

**Next Steps**:
- Post-incident review scheduled for tomorrow 10am
- Fee calculation v2.1 pulled from production deployment pipeline
- Additional integration tests required before next fee calculation changes
