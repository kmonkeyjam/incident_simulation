Feature: Subscription billing and recurring payments

This module implements changes related to: **Market Opportunity**: 67% of payment volume could be subscription-based. Currently losing deals to competitors with native subscription support.

**Subscription Engine Features**:
- **Billing Cycles**: Daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, annual billing
- **Proration Logic**: Accurate mid-cycle upgrades/downgrades with time-based calculations
- **Invoice Generation**: PDF invoices with line items, taxes, discounts
- **Payment Scheduling**: Intelligent retry scheduling for failed payments

**Dunning Management**:
- **Retry Strategy**: 3 attempts over 7 days (day 1, 3, 7)
- **Escalation Path**: Email → SMS → Phone call → Account suspension
- **Grace Periods**: Configurable by merchant (0-30 days)
- **Recovery Campaigns**: Automated win-back emails with discount offers

**Advanced Billing Features**:
- **Usage-based Billing**: Metered usage with monthly reconciliation
- **Tiered Pricing**: Volume discounts and feature tier management
- **Multi-currency**: Subscription pricing in merchant's preferred currency
- **Tax Calculation**: Integration with TaxJar for accurate tax rates

**Payment Recovery**:
- **Smart Retry**: Avoid weekends, account for payday cycles
- **Card Updater**: Automatic card refresh for expired/updated cards
- **Alternative Payment Methods**: Fallback to bank transfer for failed cards
- **Customer Self-Service**: Portal for payment method updates

**Analytics & Reporting**:
- **Churn Analysis**: Subscription cancellation patterns and reasons
- **MRR Tracking**: Monthly recurring revenue with cohort analysis
- **Dunning Effectiveness**: Recovery rates by retry attempt and channel
- **Revenue Forecasting**: Predictive models for subscription revenue

**Integration Points**:
- CRM integration for sales team visibility
- Accounting system sync for revenue recognition
- Customer support tools for subscription management

**Target Metrics**: 15% increase in merchant retention, $2M+ additional MRR within 6 months
