Feature: Automated payment reconciliation system

This module implements changes related to: **Business Need**: Manual reconciliation taking finance team 40+ hours/week. ~$50K/month in unmatched transactions requiring investigation.

**Automated Reconciliation Engine**:
- **Data Sources**: 
  - Internal transaction logs (payments DB)
  - Bank settlement files (SWIFT MT940 format)
  - Payment gateway reports (Stripe, PayPal webhooks)

**Matching Algorithms**:
- **Exact Match**: Transaction ID, amount, timestamp (±5 minutes)
- **Fuzzy Match**: Amount + date range (±1 day) for manual settlement delays
- **Batch Matching**: Aggregate settlement amounts vs. transaction batches
- **ML Matching**: XGBoost model for complex settlement patterns

**Discrepancy Detection**:
- Missing transactions (in bank but not in system)
- Extra transactions (in system but not in bank)
- Amount mismatches (currency conversion issues)
- Timing discrepancies (weekend/holiday settlement delays)

**Automated Actions**:
- Auto-resolve matches with >95% confidence
- Flag medium confidence (70-95%) for human review
- Generate exception reports for <70% confidence
- Send daily reconciliation summary emails

**Reporting Dashboard**:
- Real-time reconciliation status
- Monthly reconciliation trends
- Top discrepancy categories
- Finance team workflow queue

**Expected ROI**: 90% reduction in manual reconciliation time, saving ~$180K/year in finance team costs
